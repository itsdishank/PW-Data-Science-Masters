    "* Penalty Combination: Elastic Net Regression combines both L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) penalties in its regularization term. The objective function includes a linear combination of the sum of squared coefficients (L2 penalty) and the sum of absolute coefficients (L1 penalty). This allows Elastic Net Regression to select variables like Lasso Regression while also handling multicollinearity like Ridge Regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Sparsity and Variable Selection: Similar to Lasso Regression, Elastic Net Regression can drive some coefficients to exactly zero, resulting in sparse solutions and automatic variable selection. By setting appropriate values for the regularization parameters, Elastic Net Regression can promote sparsity and identify the most relevant predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Multicollinearity Handling: Elastic Net Regression is particularly effective when dealing with multicollinearity. The inclusion of the L2 penalty helps to reduce the impact of multicollinearity by shrinking correlated coefficients, while the L1 penalty facilitates variable selection and eliminates redundant predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Flexibility in Parameter Tuning: Elastic Net Regression introduces two tuning parameters: alpha (α) and lambda (λ). Alpha controls the mix between the L1 and L2 penalties. A value of 1 corresponds to Lasso Regression, while a value of 0 corresponds to Ridge Regression. This flexibility allows users to adjust the balance between variable selection and shrinkage based on the problem at hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Bias-Variance Trade-off: Elastic Net Regression provides a trade-off between the bias introduced by the L1 penalty and the variance reduced by the L2 penalty. By adjusting the alpha parameter, users can control this trade-off and select a model that strikes the right balance between bias and variance."

A predefined set of alpha and lambda values is chosen, covering a range of possibilities. The model is trained and evaluated for each combination of alpha and lambda using cross-validation. The combination of alpha and lambda that yields the best performance, as determined by the chosen metric, is selected as the optimal values.\n",

In this approach, an outer cross-validation loop is used to estimate the generalization performance of the final selected combination of alpha and lambda values, while an inner cross-validation loop is employed for selecting the best alpha and lambda values."
