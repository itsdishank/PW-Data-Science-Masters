    "Ordinal Encoding is a technique where categorical variables are assigned numerical values based on their order or rank. Label Encoding, on the other hand, assigns unique numerical labels to each category without considering any order or rank.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example where you might choose Ordinal Encoding is when dealing with a feature like education level, where there is a clear ordering (e.g., \"High School\" < \"Bachelor's\" < \"Master's\"). In this case, preserving the order is important for capturing the relationship between the categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "Label Encoding might be preferred when dealing with nominal variables, such as colors (e.g., \"Red,\" \"Blue,\" \"Green\"). Here, there is no inherent order, and assigning arbitrary numerical labels can effectively represent the different categories without implying any relationships.\n",

    "\n",
    "Here's an example of when you might use Target Guided Ordinal Encoding: Let's say you have a dataset with a categorical feature like \"City\" and a binary target variable indicating whether a customer made a purchase. You want to encode the \"City\" feature in a way that captures the relationship between cities and the likelihood of a purchase.\n",
