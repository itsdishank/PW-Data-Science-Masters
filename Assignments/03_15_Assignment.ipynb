    "Artificial Intelligence (AI):<br>\n",
    "Artificial Intelligence refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and learn like humans. AI enables machines to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as problem-solving, speech recognition, decision-making, and natural language processing.<br>\n",
    "Example: An example of artificial intelligence is a virtual personal assistant like Apple's Siri or Amazon's Alexa. These assistants use AI algorithms to understand user commands and respond with relevant information or perform tasks like setting reminders, playing music, or answering questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine Learning (ML):<br>\n",
    "Machine Learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on the development of algorithms and models that allow machines to learn and make predictions based on data without being explicitly programmed. ML algorithms enable systems to analyze and interpret large datasets, identify patterns, and make decisions or predictions based on the learned patterns.<br>\n",
    "Example: An example of machine learning is spam email filtering. ML algorithms can be trained on a large dataset of labeled emails (spam or not spam) to learn patterns and characteristics that distinguish between the two. Once trained, the algorithm can classify new incoming emails as spam or not spam based on the learned patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep Learning:<br>\n",
    "Deep Learning is a subfield of machine learning that specifically focuses on the development and application of artificial neural networks inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. Deep learning algorithms consist of multiple layers of interconnected nodes (neurons) that process and learn from data in a hierarchical manner.<br>\n",
    "Example: An example of deep learning is image recognition. Deep learning models, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), can be trained on a vast dataset of labeled images to learn and recognize complex patterns and features. Once trained, the model can accurately classify new images, such as identifying objects or recognizing faces, by analyzing the learned hierarchical representations within the network."
