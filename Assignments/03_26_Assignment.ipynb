    "* Simple linear regression is a statistical model that examines the linear relationship between two variables: a dependent variable (response variable) and an independent variable (predictor variable). The goal is to fit a line that best represents the relationship between the variables. It assumes that the dependent variable can be predicted using a straight line equation. For example, predicting house prices based on the size of the house is an example of simple linear regression.\n",

    "* Multiple linear regression, on the other hand, extends the concept of linear regression to include multiple independent variables that can influence the dependent variable. It examines the linear relationship between the dependent variable and two or more independent variables. The aim is to fit a linear equation that best represents the relationship between the variables. For example, predicting house prices based on multiple factors such as size, number of bedrooms, and location is an example of multiple linear regression.\n",
