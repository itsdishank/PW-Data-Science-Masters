    "Overfitting occurs when a machine learning model performs well on the training data but fails to generalize to new, unseen data. It happens when the model captures the noise or random fluctuations in the training data, leading to poor performance on test data. Consequences of overfitting include reduced accuracy, high variance, and limited ability to make accurate predictions on real-world data. To mitigate overfitting, techniques such as regularization (e.g., L1/L2 regularization), cross-validation, and early stopping can be applied, along with increasing the amount of training data or reducing model complexity.\n",

    "Underfitting occurs when a machine learning model fails to capture the underlying patterns and relationships in the data. It usually results from models being too simple or having insufficient training. Consequences of underfitting include poor performance on both training and test data, high bias, and an inability to learn complex relationships. To mitigate underfitting, one can try increasing model complexity, using more sophisticated algorithms, adding more features, or providing more training data."
