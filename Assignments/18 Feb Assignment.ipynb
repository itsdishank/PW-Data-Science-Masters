    "2. Reusability: APIs can be reused across different applications, reducing development costs and time.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Standardization: APIs provide a standard interface for accessing data and services, which promotes interoperability and compatibility.\n",

    "#### Disadvantages of using API are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Security Risks: APIs can be vulnerable to security risks such as data breaches, hacks, and unauthorized access.\n",

    "2. Dependency: If an API is discontinued or changed, it can cause problems for the applications that depend on it.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Compatibility Issues: Compatibility issues may arise between different versions of the same API, causing problems for developers."

    "REST is an architectural style that uses HTTP requests to access and manipulate data. It uses HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on resources. REST APIs are stateless, meaning they do not maintain any information about the client's session.\n",

It uses a set of rules for exchanging structured information in the form of XML documents. SOAP APIs are stateful, meaning they maintain information about the client's session.\n",

    "Shortcomings of SOAP include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Complexity: SOAP is more complex than REST, making it harder to develop and maintain.\n",
