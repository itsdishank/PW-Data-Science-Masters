    "The purpose of Grid Search CV (Cross-Validation) in machine learning is to find the optimal hyperparameters for a model. Hyperparameters are parameters that are set prior to training and determine the behavior and performance of the model. Grid Search CV exhaustively searches through a specified hyperparameter grid to identify the combination that results in the best model performance.\n",

    "* Hyperparameter Grid Definition: Define a grid of hyperparameter values to be explored. Each hyperparameter is assigned a set of possible values.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Model Training and Evaluation: For each combination of hyperparameters, train the model on a subset of the training data and evaluate its performance using cross-validation. Cross-validation helps estimate the model's performance by splitting the data into multiple subsets and iteratively training and evaluating the model on different combinations of these subsets.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Performance Evaluation: Measure the performance of the model using a specified evaluation metric, such as accuracy, precision, recall, or F1 score. The performance metric is calculated based on the model's predictions during cross-validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Selection of Best Hyperparameters: Compare the performance of different hyperparameter combinations and select the combination that yields the best performance based on the chosen evaluation metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Model Fitting with Best Hyperparameters: Train the model using the entire training dataset and the identified best hyperparameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Grid Search CV exhaustively explores all combinations of hyperparameters specified in the grid, allowing the model to find the optimal set of hyperparameters that maximize performance. By automating the search process, Grid Search CV saves time and effort in manually tuning hyperparameters."

    "Data leakage refers to the situation where information from outside the training data is used in the model development process, leading to an overly optimistic evaluation of the model's performance. It occurs when there is unintentional inclusion of data that would not be available during real-world prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data leakage is a problem in machine learning because it can result in overly optimistic performance estimates, misleading model selection, and unreliable predictions. It undermines the generalization capability of the model, as it learns patterns that are not truly representative of the underlying data distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Suppose you are building a credit risk model to predict loan defaults. During feature selection, you mistakenly include the customer's credit card balance as a predictor. However, this information is not available at the time of making predictions because it represents the outcome of interest (defaults). Including this variable would lead to data leakage, as the model would indirectly \"peek\" into future information. Consequently, the model's performance would be overly optimistic during training, but it would fail to generalize well to new data.\n",

    "Data leakage can also occur in other ways, such as using future data for feature engineering, incorporating target variable statistics into the model, or using data that is outside the intended temporal order.
