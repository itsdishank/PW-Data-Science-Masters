    "Ridge Regression is a linear regression technique that introduces a regularization term to the ordinary least squares (OLS) regression. It aims to address the issue of multicollinearity, where predictor variables are highly correlated.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Ridge Regression, the regularization term, also known as the L2 penalty, is added to the sum of squared residuals in the OLS objective function. This penalty term is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the coefficient values, multiplied by a regularization parameter (lambda or alpha). By including this penalty term, Ridge Regression discourages large coefficient values and promotes a more stable and less sensitive model.\n",

    "Differences from ordinary least squares regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Regularization: Ridge Regression adds a penalty term to the OLS objective function, while ordinary least squares regression does not include any regularization.\n",

    "Ridge Regression shares many assumptions with ordinary least squares (OLS) regression, but there are additional assumptions specific to Ridge Regression. The assumptions of Ridge Regression include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Linearity: The relationship between the predictors and the response variable is assumed to be linear. If the relationship is non-linear, appropriate transformations may be required.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Independence: The observations are assumed to be independent of each other. There should be no autocorrelation or dependence among the residuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Homoscedasticity: The variance of the residuals is constant across all levels of the predictors. This assumption ensures that the model's predictions have consistent variability.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Normality: The residuals are assumed to follow a normal distribution. This assumption allows for valid statistical inference and hypothesis testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "* No perfect multicollinearity: The predictors should not have perfect multicollinearity, meaning they should not be perfectly linearly dependent on each other. Ridge Regression helps address multicollinearity, but severe multicollinearity can still lead to unstable coefficient estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Predictor scaling: Ridge Regression assumes that the predictors are on a similar scale. It is advisable to standardize the predictors before performing Ridge Regression to ensure their comparability."

    "The magnitude of the coefficients in Ridge Regression is controlled by the tuning parameter lambda (also known as alpha).

This can be accomplished through techniques such as one-hot encoding, dummy coding, or effect coding.

Additionally, scaling or standardizing the continuous variables is recommended to ensure fair comparisons between the coefficient estimates of categorical and continuous variables."

Coefficients that are closer to zero have undergone more shrinkage due to regularization and have a relatively smaller impact on the model. Therefore, comparing the relative magnitudes of the coefficients can provide insights into the importance of different variables in predicting the dependent variable."
