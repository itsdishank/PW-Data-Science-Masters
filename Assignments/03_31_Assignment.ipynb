    "Traditional web hosting and cloud hosting are two different approaches to hosting websites and applications. Here's a comparison of the two:\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional Web Hosting:\n",
    "\n",
    "* In traditional web hosting, your website/application is hosted on a physical server or a shared server provided by a hosting provider.\n",
    "* You have a fixed amount of server resources allocated to your website/application.\n",
    "* Scaling resources can be limited, and you may need to upgrade to a higher hosting plan or server to handle increased traffic or resource demands.\n",
    "* The infrastructure is typically managed and maintained by the hosting provider, and you have limited control over the underlying infrastructure.\n",
    "* Pricing is often based on fixed plans or packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cloud Hosting:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Cloud hosting utilizes virtualized resources and infrastructure from a cloud service provider (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud).\n",
    "* Your website/application is hosted across multiple virtual servers or instances, providing scalability and flexibility.\n",
    "* Resources can be dynamically scaled up or down based on demand, allowing for efficient handling of traffic spikes or varying workloads.\n",
    "* You have more control over the infrastructure, with options to customize and configure the environment to meet specific requirements.\n",
    "* Pay-as-you-go pricing model allows you to pay for the resources you actually use, providing cost optimization.\n",
    "* Cloud hosting offers features like load balancing, auto-scaling, and high availability to ensure reliable performance."

    "* Build the user interface: Create the user interface using web development technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Design the interface to collect the necessary inputs from the user, such as geographical coordinates, weather conditions, and other relevant parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Backend Development: Implement the backend of the application to handle user input and integrate it with the machine learning model. This can be done using a server-side programming language like Python and a web framework like Flask or Django.\n",
    "\n",
    "* API Integration: Expose the machine learning model as an API endpoint that the user interface can interact with. You can use libraries like Flask-RESTful or Django REST Framework to build the API endpoints and handle requests and responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Data Processing: Collect the user inputs from the interface, preprocess them if required, and pass them to the machine learning model for prediction. Ensure the data is transformed or normalized according to the model's requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Model Inference: Use the saved machine learning model to make predictions based on the user inputs. Pass the processed data to the model and retrieve the predicted output, such as the probability or severity of a forest fire.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Display Results: Once the prediction is obtained, display the results on the user interface. This can include visualizations, textual feedback, or any other appropriate representation of the model's output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Libraries used are\n",
    "\n",
    "* Flask\n",
    "* numpy \n",
    "* pandas\n",
