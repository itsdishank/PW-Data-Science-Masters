    "A database is a structured collection of data that is organized and managed to allow for efficient storage, retrieval, and manipulation of data. A database can be of various types, including SQL and NoSQL databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main differences between SQL and NoSQL databases are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Data model: SQL databases use a structured, table-based model, while NoSQL databases use a non-structured or semi-structured model.\n",
    "2. Query language: SQL databases use SQL for querying and data manipulation, while NoSQL databases use their own query languages, such as MongoDB Query Language (MQL) or Cassandra Query Language (CQL).\n",
    "3. Scalability: NoSQL databases are more scalable than SQL databases, as they are designed for distributed architectures and can easily handle large amounts of data and high traffic volumes."
